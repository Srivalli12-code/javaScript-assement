Here are some **programming assessment questions** focused on **if-else conditionals**. These questions cover various levels of difficulty, from beginner to advanced, and they test a candidate's ability to think logically and apply conditional logic in different scenarios.

---

### 1. **Basic Questions**

#### 1.1 **Even or Odd Number**
Write a program to check if a number entered by the user is **even** or **odd**.

#### 1.2 **Check if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero**
Write a program to check if a number entered by the user is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero**.

#### 1.3 **Grade Evaluation**
Write a program that accepts a student's **score** and prints:
- **A** if the score is between 90 and 100 (inclusive),
- **B** if the score is between 80 and 89,
- **C** if the score is between 70 and 79,
- **D** if the score is between 60 and 69,
- **F** if the score is below 60.

### 2. **Intermediate Questions**

#### 2.1 **Leap Year Check**
Write a program to check whether a given year is a **leap year** or not. A year is a leap year if:
- It is divisible by 4, **and**
- It is **not divisible** by 100 unless it is divisible by 400.

#### 2.2 **Find the Largest of Three Numbers**
Write a program that accepts three numbers from the user and prints the **largest number**. If all the numbers are equal, print "All numbers are equal."

#### 2.3 **Check Divisibility by 3 or 5**
Write a program that takes a number and checks:
- If the number is divisible by 3, print "Divisible by 3."
- If the number is divisible by 5, print "Divisible by 5."
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "Divisible by both 3 and 5."
- If neither, print "Not divisible by 3 or 5."

### 3. **Advanced Questions**

#### 3.1 **Find the Second Largest Number**
Write a program that takes three numbers and returns the **second-largest number**. If there are two or more numbers that are equal, return that number.

#### 3.2 **Check Whether a Number is Prime**
Write a program to check whether a given number is **prime** or **not**. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

#### 3.3 **Check Age for Voting**
Write a program that takes a person's **age** and prints:
- "Eligible to vote" if the age is **18 or older**.
- "Not eligible to vote" if the age is **below 18**.
- If the age is below 0 or more than 120, print an "Invalid age" message.

#### 3.4 **Sum of Digits**
Write a program that calculates the **sum of digits** of a given number. For example:
- Input: 1234
- Output: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10

#### 3.5 **Check Whether a Triangle is Valid**
Write a program to check whether the three given sides can form a **valid triangle**. A triangle is valid if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.

### 4. **Logic and Edge Case Questions**

#### 4.1 **Smallest of Three Numbers**
Write a program that takes three numbers and prints the **smallest number**. Consider edge cases like two or more equal numbers.

#### 4.2 **Check for Palindrome Number**
Write a program that checks if a given number is a **palindrome** or not. A palindrome number reads the same backward as forward. For example:
- Input: 121
- Output: Yes (It's a palindrome)

#### 4.3 **Calculate the Discount on Price**
Write a program that takes a **price** and applies a **discount** based on the following conditions:
- If the price is greater than or equal to $100, apply a 10% discount.
- If the price is between $50 and $100, apply a 5% discount.
- If the price is less than $50, apply no discount.

Print the **final price** after applying the discount.

#### 4.4 **FizzBuzz Problem**
Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 100. However:
- If a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz."
- If a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz."
- If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."
- Otherwise, print the number itself.

### 5. **Real-Life Scenario Based Questions**

#### 5.1 **Determine Tax Bracket**
Write a program to calculate the **tax** based on the salary:
- If the salary is less than $30,000, the tax is 10% of the salary.
- If the salary is between $30,000 and $60,000, the tax is 20% of the salary.
- If the salary is above $60,000, the tax is 30% of the salary.

#### 5.2 **Check if an Email is Valid**
Write a program to check whether an entered email address is **valid** based on the following conditions:
- It should contain **"@"**.
- It should contain at least one **"."** after the "@" symbol.
- The length should be at least **5 characters**.

#### 5.3 **Shipping Cost Based on Weight**
Write a program that calculates the shipping cost based on the weight of a package:
- If the weight is **less than or equal to 5 kg**, the shipping cost is **$10**.
- If the weight is **greater than 5 kg but less than or equal to 20 kg**, the shipping cost is **$20**.
- If the weight is **greater than 20 kg**, the shipping cost is **$50**.
